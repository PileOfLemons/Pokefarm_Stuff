Add these CSS files to your QoL and it will put labels onto your eggs. 
I have made one that puts exp and pokemon names on it. and there is also a version with just exp if you do not want the names on your screen as well.

So the Egg Label CSS was originally made by Sagidamas. It was updated by Retsky to include some newer pokemon. I have updated it again to just put the exp after the pokemon's name for all of the pokemon.
